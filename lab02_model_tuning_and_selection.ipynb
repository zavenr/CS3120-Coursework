These latter two concepts are general and can be difficult to articulate, but are really important in the world of ML. They also often show up in job interviews for Data Science and/or Machine Learning, so it's important that you understand them well enough to be able to describe/explain what they are to someone else. Although this is succinctly referred to as \"_Model Selection_\", we can also think of this as trying to better understand a model's future prediction accuracy.\n",

When we say \"_tune_\" a model, what we mean is that we want to find the ideal value of the model's [hyperparameter(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_(machine_learning)). Remember that a `hyperparameter` is a parameter of a model that is not fit/learned directly from the data. Rather, it is a value that determines _how the model will learn_ from the data. Some examples are:\n",
        "* `max_depth` of a Decision Tree - the maximum depth of a decision tree is not directly learned from the data, but it will affect how the model learns, and ultimately how many parameters will be in the tree\n",

        "\n",
        "Note that there are often times more than one hyperparameter. Below we are trying many values of a hyperparameter, e.g. $n_{h1}$ possible values. However, if there were multiple hyperparameters and the second one had $n_{h2}$ possible values, and the third had $n_{h3}$, ..., and the $k^{th}$ had $n_{hk}$ possible values, then there would be a huge number of possible combinations that we would need to consider (namely, $n_{h1}\\cdot n_{h2}\\cdot \\dots \\cdot n_{hk}$). Fortunately, most models do not have too many hyperparameters to consider, or perhaps not many values of each to consider, so in practice this is typically not too onerous. But, be careful about trying to tune a model for every possible hyperparameter."

Therefore, what we really need to do is to _estimate_ what our model's future accuracy will be. Which means that we have to get an idea of how much the accuracy (or RMSE) will vary from one _test_ dataset to another. As you know from basic Statistics, this sounds a lot like trying to understand the variance of the model's performance metric for all possible future test datasets.\n",
